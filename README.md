# E80Section3Team2
The Arduino and MATLAB Code for Spring 2018 Engineering 80 Section 2 Team 2

Hello team,
Welcome to Github! Here are a few basic directions.

## Initial Setup
1. Set up a folder on your computer where you want to put this GitHub file (ex: 'E80 Code in Documents')
2. Use cd command on the CMD line to get to the folder
3. Type `git clone (web address for repository)` into the command line
4. If it asks use for your username and password, type it in
5. You're done!

## General Setup (Do each time you want to edit some code)
1. Use `git checkout branch-(branch Name)` to move to a new branch
   NOTE: MOVE TO THE BRANCH BEFORE UPDATING ANY CODE
2. Use `git pull` to update your code from the current branch

## Pushing (for when you're done with the code)
1. Use `git add .` to add all of the changed files to the commit
2. Use `git commit -m "Insert description of changes here"` to commit
3. Use `git push` to push to the current branch

## Merging
I'm kind of shaky on this. We can just do this manually because its small.
